title: Trash Away Robot
description: We created a simulated 3D environment in which a robot has to detect and move cubes outside of a squared area. Using computer vision (a camera is the only sensor) and reinforcement learning, we successfully solved the task and correctly deployed the robot in the real world on the first try.
