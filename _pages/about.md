I received my master's degree (cum laude) in Computer Science, specialization in Artificial Intelligence, at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en) in 2023. Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia](https://international.unimore.it/).

My primary research interests are in machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on representation learning and self-supervised learning. I am also interested in vision-language models, (model-based) reinforcement learning, and external memories for artificial neural networks.

I am currently searching for a PhD position in one of the listed areas or a related one.
